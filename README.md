# Typing In Chat Plugin
Enable you server to show when players actively typing in chat.
Server admins should install plugin on their server. Everyone who install [clientside mod](https://github.com/Orphey98/TypingInChat-Mod) will have special indication while they are typing in chat. <br>
Players who do not have client-side mod will only see other player's indicators and will not have their own.
